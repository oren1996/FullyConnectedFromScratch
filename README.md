# FullyConnectedFromScratch
I wrote this code to train a neural network on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. The code defines a neural network class with an initialization method, activation functions, forward propagation, backward propagation, and update parameters. The neural network has three hidden layers and an output layer with softmax activation. The code also sets hyperparameters such as layer dimensions, number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, and number of labels. It loads the MNIST dataset using torchvision.datasets and creates data loaders for the training and test datasets. Finally, the code trains the neural network on the MNIST dataset by iterating over the training data, scaling and shifting the inputs, creating the target output values, performing forward and backward propagation, and updating the parameters using stochastic gradient descent.
